# Project #3. Connect Private Blockchain to Front-End Client via APIs

This is Project 3, Connect Private Blockchain to Front-End Client via APIs, in this project I created the GET and POST endpoint using node Express framework  .

## Setup project for Review.

To setup the project for review do the following:
1. Download the project.
2. Run command __npm install__ to install the project dependencies.
3. Run command __nodemon or node index.js__ in the root directory.

## Testing the project

The file __index.js__ in the root directory has the server up and running in localhost
http://localhost:8000/  to be able to test the endpoint , you could use Postman:

*  to Test this routes in Postman:
```

     1.  `GET /block/:index` - returns a single Block from the database. .
     
     2.  `POST /block` - adds a new block to the database. Test this route by doing a POST request in Postman with a made up Block.
     
```

This function validates the whole chain and return a list of errors found during the validation.
